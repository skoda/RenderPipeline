          <h3>What?</h3>
          A software renderer. Using no external libraries beyond what's native to JS in browsers,
          render-pipeline is a fixed-function pipeline for rendering triangle based 3D primitives
          into an HTML Canvas element.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>When?</h3>
          It came out of some school projects between 2004 and 2005. Around 2010 I cobbled
          together that work into a version rendering a single cube while learning JavaScript. In
          the early 2020s, I rebuilt it as a library in Typescript to add some functionality I'd
          always wanted to add, like multiple triangle streams and primitive types, triangle
          clipping, depth buffering, and others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Where?</h3>
          DigiPen coursework, particularly from CS200 and CS250 courses on rasterization and 3D
          graphics. Later, hosting a simple rendered cube on my website. Now the library is
          available on Github.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Why?</h3>
          Typescript and the JavaScript virtual machine are not a good fit for a rendering
          pipeline, but it's fun to see how performant browsers have become. Maybe someone will
          learn something about 3D graphics from poking around. It's one of a few pet projects
          I kick around when picking up new tools and technology to use, and computer graphics has
          always been an area of interest to me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How?</h3>
          Most of my learnings on graphics is dated, but much of it was from classes at DigiPen in
          the early aughts. What gaps were left from classes were largely filled in a few readings
          of <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com">Real-Time Rendering</a> which is still a
          fantastic resource for anyone interested.
