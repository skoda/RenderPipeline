          <h3>What</h3>
          Real-time, fully software based 3D rendering pipeline. Using no external libraries beyond
          what's native to JS in browsers (a few Math functions and DOM objects), render-pipeline
          can render triangle based 3D primitives directly to pixels in an HTML Canvas element.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>When and Where</h3>
          It came out of my DigiPen coursework, particularly from CS200 and CS250 courses on
          rasterization and 3D graphics in the early 2000s. Around 2010 I cobbled together that
          work into a version <a href="https://chuckskoda.com/JSRender/">rendering a single
          cube</a> while I was learning JavaScript. In 2023, I rebuilt it
          <a href="https://github.com/skoda/RenderPipeline">as a library</a> while learning
          Typescript to add some functionality I'd always wanted to build, like multiple triangle
          streams and primitive types, triangle clipping, depth buffering, and others.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Why</h3>
          Typescript and the JavaScript virtual machine are a terrible fit for a rendering
          pipeline, but it's fun to see how performant browsers have become. Maybe someone will
          learn something about 3D graphics from poking around. It's one of a few pet projects
          I kick around when picking up new tools and technology to use, and computer graphics has
          always been an area of interest to me.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>How</h3>
          Most of my learnings on graphics is dated, but much of it was from classes at DigiPen in
          the early aughts. What gaps were left from classes were largely filled in a few readings
          of <a href="https://www.realtimerendering.com">Real-Time Rendering</a> which is still a
          fantastic resource for anyone interested.
